/*

This presentational component of the 'record/player' will house a 'record/disk' selected by the user for playing.

WHEN a 'record/covers/single' has been clicked
  AND no 'record/disk' is currently stationed above the 'record/player/platter',
    THEN a 'record/disk' will
      ^^move^^
        FROM the 'record/covers/single' in question
        TO the 'record/player/platter'

Similar tests will be written at a later date.
