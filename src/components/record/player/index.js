/*

This component is responsible for housing the presentational record player.

It primarily renders the container div styled after the player of choice (tbd), whose critical inner components include:

  - A 'record/player/platter' where a selected 'record/disk' will be placed/removed in between active musical selections.
  - A 'record/player/needle' that dynamically moves depending on situational context (see component for more),
  - And 'record/player/controls' for sound manipulation features necessary for a good time :-) .
