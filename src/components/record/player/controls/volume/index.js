/*

This component is responsible for housing the slider bar that allows the user
the ability to modify the volume of the music currently being played.

It is still TBD whether this will be a slider, or a knob.

The quantity of the slider at any given moment represents how loud the music currently playing will be on the user's device.

WHEN the slider's value is incremented, THEN the user's device will play more loudly.
WHEN the slider's value is decremented, THEN the user's device will play more softly.

** Future feature: WHEN the slider's value is set to 0, THEN the track will be paused. **
